# Tech-Store-Inventory-Management-System

This project implements a system for tracking and managing the inventory of a tech store. The system allows customers to place orders for products, while the store keeps track of product availability, customer information, and order details. The system includes the following key features:

- **Product Management**: Ability to add, update, and remove products from the inventory.
- **Customer Management**: Allows the creation of customer profiles and keeps track of their orders.
- **Order Processing**: Customers can place orders, and the system will update inventory accordingly.
- **Inventory Update**: The inventory is updated whenever an order is placed.
